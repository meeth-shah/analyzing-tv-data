# Analyzing TV Data
This repository contains my project from DataCamp on analyzing TV data using Python. The project involves data manipulation and visualization techniques to explore different datasets related to television viewership and content quality.

## Project Overview
### Super Bowl Data Analysis

In the guided section of the project, I analyzed Super Bowl data to extract insights about game outcomes, viewership trends, and halftime shows. This involved using Python libraries like pandas and matplotlib to manipulate data and create informative visualizations.
